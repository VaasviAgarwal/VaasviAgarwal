# Hi, I’m **Vaasvi Agarwal** 👋

🎓 I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Advanced Software Engineering at King’s College London.

👩‍💻 I have experience as a **Technical Product Developer** at Tropical Marine Centre, where I focus on creating user-centric applications and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

💡 My skills include software development, testing, deployment, and design thinking, with a strong foundation in **Python** and **Java**. I also have experience with **React** from my master’s project, which focused on improving audio content accessibility for individuals with aphasia.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving **Java, C++, Python,** or **Web Development**.

📫 Feel free to reach out via email at [agarwalvaasvi@gmail.com](mailto:agarwalvaasvi@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaasvi-agarwal/).
